# RiskWatch

A website that helps you determine whether you are at risk of certain diseases through questionnaires. Feel free to check out our [original solution using this link (https://github.com/ha36ad/SpotlightProject)](https://github.com/ha36ad/SpotlightProject).

This website was an extension for one of our proposed solutions for our problem pitch for the Spotlight Mentorship Program.

The Blindspot we were trying to address was: Lack of technological innovation in healthcare such as AI assisted analysis and diagnosis.

This is a work in progress, new questionnaires for more illnesses are planned to be added.
